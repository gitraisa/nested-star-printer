# nested-star-printer
My first step in mastering nested loops in C. It visualizes 3D data by printing stars in layers: i as levels, j as rows, and k as stars. Simple code builds structured, meaningful patterns, just like life. With input validation and color, itâ€™s both educational and visually engaging. A key step in my growth as a software engineer.
