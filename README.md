# nested-star-printer
My first step in mastering nested loops in C. It visualizes 3D data by printing stars in layers: i as levels, j as rows, and k as stars. Simple code builds structured, meaningful patterns, just like life. With input validation and color, itâ€™s both educational and visually engaging. A key step in my growth as a software engineer.

This is a C program that uses nested loops to print patterns of stars, visualizing 3D dimensions.

## About

This project helps beginners understand nested loops by printing stars arranged by three ranges (`i`, `j`, `k`). It includes input validation and color output to enhance user experience.

## How to Run

1. Compile the program with:
   ```bash
   gcc nested_star.c -o nested_star
   ./nested_star
